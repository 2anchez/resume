## Project 2 - Turn Your Resume Into a Web Page

As a newly established web developer, you are considering how to attract more clients. After doing some research, you found that the single most useful way to do that is to develop your online presence.

As a web developer, it makes sense for you to create your own website to test that theory! Since you don't want to pay for a server at first, you decide to host it using the Github Pages service. You immediately create an account on the website to try it out. Satisfied with how easy it was, you decide to do a bit more research to find out what makes a good online resume, and finally settle on this template as a mockup:

Your website should feel like your own, and using a template makes it a bit too generic. Using Material Design colors, and Font Awesome, you decide to add a little personality to your website by changing the dominant color and the icons.

### Deliverables

* A link to your Github or Gitlab repository
    + You should version your code on GitHub or Gitlab.
    + Your repository should be available.

* A link to your hosted webpage to showcase your resume on Github Pages or Gitlab Pages.

### Presentation

You'll do an oral presentation of your project with an assessor in order to imitate real-life conditions. Your assessor, in this case, will play the role of a client who found you through your website contact information and sent you the following message:

Your evaluation session will proceed as follows:

* Presentation of deliverables (15 minutes)
    + Briefly present your resume/CV.
    + Explain how your skills in HTML and CSS can be applied to create a front page for their business.
    + Explain how you used Git and Github to host your project.

* Discussion (10 minutes)
    + Playing the role of client, the assessor will ask you questions about your methodology and your deliverables.

* The assessor will challenge your decisions, so be prepared to defend your work. At the end of the session, the assessor will stop playing the role of client so that you can debrief together.
